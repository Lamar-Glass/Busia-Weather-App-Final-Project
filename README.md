## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔐 Set Up Your OpenWeather API Key

1. Go to [https://home.openweathermap.org](https://home.openweathermap.org)  
2. Create a **free account**  
3. Visit [https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys)  
4. Copy your **API key**  
5. In your IDE (e.g. VS Code), open the `.env` file  
6. You'll see this line:

   ```env
   VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=
Paste your key like this:

env
Copy
Edit
VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
⚠️ Keep your API key private — never share it in public repos!

🧪 Installation & Running the App
1. Clone the Repository
For Linux or in your VS Code terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd Desktop
git clone https://github.com/Lamar-Glass/Busia-Weather-App-Final-Project.git
cd Busia-Weather-App-Final-Project
2. Install dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
3. Start the development server
bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
You should see something like:

arduino
Copy
Edit
VITE v5.x.x  ready in XXX ms
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
➜  Network: http://your-ip:5173/
🌐 Open the App in Your Browser
Copy the local address (e.g., http://localhost:5173/)

Paste it in your browser

If your browser asks for location permission, click Allow

This enables the app to show current weather based on your IP or location

✅ Summary
This app represents the final checkpoint in my front-end learning milestone. It demonstrates clean code, third-party API integration, and responsive layout techniques using modern web tools like React and Vite.
