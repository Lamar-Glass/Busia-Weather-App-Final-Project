## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔐 Step 1: Set Up Your OpenWeather API Key

To use the app, you must provide your own free API key from OpenWeather:

1. Go to [https://home.openweathermap.org](https://home.openweathermap.org) and sign up for a free account  
2. Navigate to [https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys)  
3. Copy your personal **API key**  
4. In your project directory, open the `.env` file  
5. Paste your API key into the following line:

   ```env
   VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

> ⚠️ **Important:** Keep your `.env` file private — never commit it to a public repository.

---

### 🧪 Step 2: Install & Run the App Locally

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/Lamar-Glass/Busia-Weather-App-Final-Project.git
cd Busia-Weather-App-Final-Project
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### 3. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

After running the command, Vite will display something like:

```
VITE v5.x.x  ready in XXX ms
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
➜  Network: http://your-ip:5173/
```

---

## 🌐 Step 3: Open the App in Your Browser

- Copy the **local address** (usually `http://localhost:5173/`)  
- Paste it into your web browser  
- If prompted for **location access**, click **Allow**  
  - This helps the app show weather for your current location or IP region

## ✅ Project Summary

This project represents the final checkpoint of my front-end learning milestone. It demonstrates key skills in:
- Third-party API integration  
- Responsive design with modern UI practices  
- Clean code structure and component-based development  
- Tooling with React, Vite, and TypeScript  

It serves as both a learning achievement and a foundation for future full-stack and AI-driven applications.
