## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔐 Set Up Your OpenWeather API Key

1. Go to [https://home.openweathermap.org](https://home.openweathermap.org)
2. Create a **free account**
3. After logging in, go to [https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys)
4. Copy your **API key**
5. In your IDE (e.g., VS Code), find and open the file named `.env`
6. Inside, you'll see this line:

   ```env
   VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=
Paste your API key after the =, like this:

env
Copy
Edit
VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
⚠️ Keep your API key private — never share it in public repos.

🧪 Installation & Running the App
1. Clone the repository
If you're using Linux, just open the terminal. If you're on Windows, use the VS Code terminal.

bash
Copy
Edit
cd Desktop
git clone https://github.com/Lamar-Glass/Busia-Weather-App-Final-Project.git
cd Busia-Weather-App-Final-Project
2. Install dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed, then run:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
3. Start the development server
bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
You'll see an output like:

arduino
Copy
Edit
VITE v5.x.x  ready in XXX ms
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
➜  Network: http://your-ip:5173/
🌐 Open the App in Your Browser
Copy the Local address (usually http://localhost:5173/)

Paste it into your browser

If the browser asks for your location, click Allow

This helps the app fetch weather for your actual location or network zone

✅ Summary
This project serves as the final checkpoint for my front-end milestone in my self-taught developer journey. It's a great example of API use, dynamic interfaces, and simple deployment workflows using tools like Vite and React.

🙏 Thank You
Thanks for checking out this project!
Enjoy using it, and may the forecast be in your favor 🌦️
